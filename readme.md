# `stickerb(r)ush-symphony.de`

This repo contains the source code of the website located at `stickerbush-symphony.de`, redirected to by `stickerbrush-symphony.de`.

A website dedicated to one of video game music's best tracks, _Stickerbush Symphony_, written by David Wise for Rareware's _Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest_ on the Super Nintendo Enertainment System (SNES).



## The Idea

... behind this website is that people can visit it while studying or working and listen to the track in an endless loop (and optionally enjoying the visuals too, maybe even in fullscreen mode).

I was one of the lucky people that discovered the original taia777 videos before they got taken down by Nintendo alongside most of GilvaSunner's videos.

This website was first registered on 2021-05-22, about three months before the takedown happened around the end of August.
You could say the legacy of the original 2h video lives on through my website, but that is a huge overstatement, as there is no comment section users could fill with their personal checkpoints 🫤



## The History

This website was originally as minimalistic as possible: Just the background GIF, an `<audio>` element and some information, with inline CSS.

Later on, I did some refactoring; splitting the file into `index.html` with a separate `css` file. I also added JavaScript and improved the website's general usability.
